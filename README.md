Assignment for week 15 of Dataviz (Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards)

## Introduction
Welcome to belly button diversity where you can use our app to look at various test subjects and the bacteria found in their belly button. 
## How to use
Use the link https://jakegeiser.github.io/javascript-plotly-challenge/ to go to the app. Here you will find the test subjects demographics, how often they wash their belly button, a bar chart of the top ten bacteria populations found, and a bubble chart with all the bacteria found. There is a dropdown box that can be used to change the test subject you are viewing.
